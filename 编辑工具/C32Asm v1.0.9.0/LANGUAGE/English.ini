Magic=Magic
Magic_Idc=A signature WORD, identifying what type of header this is. The two most common values are IMAGE_NT_OPTIONAL_HDR32_MAGIC 0x10b and IMAGE_NT_OPTIONAL_HDR64_MAGIC 0x20b.
MajorLinkerVersion=MajorLinkerVersion
MajorLinkerVersion_Idc=The major version of the linker used to build this executable. For PE files from the Microsoft linker, this version number corresponds to the Visual Studio version number (for example, version 6 for Visual Studio 6.0).
MinorLinkerVersion=MinorLinkerVersion
MinorLinkerVersion_Idc=The minor version of the linker used to build this executable.
SizeOfCode=SizeOfCode
SizeOfCode_Idc=The combined total size of all sections with the IMAGE_SCN_CNT_CODE attribute.
SizeOfInitializedData=SizeOfInitializedData
SizeOfInitializedData_Idc=The combined size of all initialized data sections.
SizeOfUninitializedData=SizeOfUninitializedData
SizeOfUninitializedData_Idc=The size of all sections with the uninitialized data attributes. This field will often be 0, since the linker can append uninitialized data to the end of regular data sections.
AddressOfEntryPoint=AddressOfEntryPoint
AddressOfEntryPoint_Idc=The RVA of the first code byte in the file that will be executed. For DLLs, this entrypoint is called during process initialization and shutdown and during thread creations/destructions. In most executables, this address doesn't directly point to main, WinMain, or DllMain. Rather, it points to runtime library code that calls the aforementioned functions. This field can be set to 0 in DLLs, and none of the previous notifications will be received. The linker /NOENTRY switch sets this field to 0.
BaseOfCode=BaseOfCode
BaseOfCode_Idc=The RVA of the first byte of code when loaded in memory.
BaseOfData=BaseOfData
BaseOfData_Idc=Theoretically, the RVA of the first byte of data when loaded into memory. However, the values for this field are inconsistent with different versions of the Microsoft linker. This field is not present in 64-bit executables.
ImageBase=ImageBase
ImageBase_Idc=The preferred load address of this file in memory. The loader attempts to load the PE file at this address if possible (that is, if nothing else currently occupies that memory, it's aligned properly and at a legal address, and so on). If the executable loads at this address, the loader can skip the step of applying base relocations (described in Part 2 of this article). For EXEs, the default ImageBase is 0x400000. For DLLs, it's 0x10000000. The ImageBase can be set at link time with the /BASE switch, or later with the REBASE utility.
SectionAlignment=SectionAlignment
SectionAlignment_Idc=The alignment of sections when loaded into memory. The alignment must be greater or equal to the file alignment field (mentioned next). The default alignment is the page size of the target CPU. For user mode executables to run under Windows 9x or Windows Me, the minimum alignment size is a page (4KB). This field can be set with the linker /ALIGN switch.
FileAlignment=FileAlignment
FileAlignment_Idc=The alignment of sections within the PE file. For x86 executables, this value is usually either 0x200 or 0x1000. The default has changed with different versions of the Microsoft linker. This value must be a power of 2, and if the SectionAlignment is less than the CPU's page size, this field must match the SectionAlignment. The linker switch /OPT:WIN98 sets the file alignment on x86 executables to 0x1000, while /OPT:NOWIN98 sets the alignment to 0x200.
MajorOperatingSystemVersion=MajorOperatingSystemVersion
MajorOperatingSystemVersion_Idc=The major version number of the required operating system. With the advent of so many versions of Windows, this field has effectively become irrelevant.
MinorOperatingSystemVersion=MinorOperatingSystemVersion
MinorOperatingSystemVersion_Idc=The minor version number of the required OS.
MajorImageVersion=MajorImageVersion
MajorImageVersion_Idc=The major version number of this file. Unused by the system and can be 0. It can be set with the linker /VERSION switch.
MinorImageVersion=MinorImageVersion
MinorImageVersion_Idc=The minor version number of this file.
MajorSubsystemVersion=MajorSubsystemVersion
MajorSubsystemVersion_Idc=The major version of the operating subsystem needed for this executable. At one time, it was used to indicate that the newer Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 user interface was required, as opposed to older versions of the Windows NT interface. Today, because of the proliferation of the various versions of Windows, this field is effectively unused by the system and is typically set to the value 4. Set with the linker /SUBSYSTEM switch.
MinorSubsystemVersion=MinorSubsystemVersion
MinorSubsystemVersion_Idc=The minor version of the operating subsystem needed for this executable.
Win32VersionValue=Win32VersionValue
Win32VersionValue_Idc=Another field that never took off. Typically set to 0.
SizeOfImage=SizeOfImage
SizeOfImage_Idc=SSizeOfImage contains the RVA that would be assigned to the section following the last section if it existed. This is effectively the amount of memory that the system needs to reserve when loading this file into memory. This field must be a multiple of the section alignment.
SizeOfHeaders=SizeOfHeaders
SizeOfHeaders_Idc=The combined size of the MS-DOS header, PE headers, and section table. All of these items will occur before any code or data sections in the PE file. The value of this field is rounded up to a multiple of the file alignment.
CheckSum=CheckSum
CheckSum_Idc=The checksum of the image. The CheckSumMappedFile API in IMAGEHLP.DLL can calculate this value. Checksums are required for kernel-mode drivers and some system DLLs. Otherwise, this field can be 0. The checksum is placed in the file when the /RELEASE linker switch is used.
Subsystem=Subsystem
Subsystem_Idc=An enum value indicating what subsystem (user interface type) the executable expects. This field is only important for EXEs. Important values include: 
DllCharacteristics=DllCharacteristics
DllCharacteristics_Idc=Flags indicating characteristics of this DLL. These correspond to the IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_xxx fields #defines. Current values are:
SizeOfStackReserve=SizeOfStackReserve
SizeOfStackReserve_Idc=In EXE files, the maximum size the initial thread in the process can grow to. This is 1MB by default. Not all this memory is committed initially.
SizeOfStackCommit=SizeOfStackCommit
SizeOfStackCommit_Idc=In EXE files, the amount of memory initially committed to the stack. By default, this field is 4KB.
SizeOfHeapReserve=SizeOfHeapReserve
SizeOfHeapReserve_Idc=In EXE files, the initial reserved size of the default process heap. This is 1MB by default. In current versions of Windows, however, the heap can grow beyond this size without intervention by the user.
SizeOfHeapCommit=SizeOfHeapCommit
SizeOfHeapCommit_Idc=In EXE files, the size of memory committed to the heap. By default, this is 4KB.
LoaderFlags=LoaderFlags
LoaderFlags_Idc=This is obsolete.
NumberOfRvaAndSizes=NumberOfRvaAndSizes
NumberOfRvaAndSizes_Idc=At the end of the IMAGE_NT_HEADERS structure is an array of IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY structures. This field contains the number of entries in the array. This field has been 16 since the earliest releases of Windows NT.
DataDirectory=DataDirectory
DataDirectory_Idc=An array of IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY structures. Each structure contains the RVA and size of some important part of the executable (for instance, imports, exports, resources).
VirtualAddress=VirtualAddress
VirtualAddress_Idc=VirtualAddress
Size=Size
Size_Idc=Size
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT_Idc=Points to the exports (an IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY structure).
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT_Idc=Points to the imports (an array of IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR structures).
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_RESOURCE=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_RESOURCE
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_RESOURCE_Idc=Points to the resources (an IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY structure.
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXCEPTION=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXCEPTION
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXCEPTION_Idc=Points to the exception handler table (an array of IMAGE_RUNTIME_FUNCTION_ENTRY structures). CPU-specific and for table-based exception handling. Used on every CPU except the x86.
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_SECURITY=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_SECURITY
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_SECURITY_Idc=Points to a list of WIN_CERTIFICATE structures, defined in WinTrust.H. Not mapped into memory as part of the image. Therefore, the VirtualAddress field is a file offset, rather than an RVA.
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC_Idc=Points to the base relocation information.
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DEBUG=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DEBUG
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DEBUG_Idc=Points to an array of IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY structures, each describing some debug information for the image. Early Borland linkers set the Size field of this IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY entry to the number of structures, rather than the size in bytes. To get the number of IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORYs, divide the Size field by the size of an IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY. 
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_ARCHITECTURE=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_ARCHITECTURE
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_ARCHITECTURE_Idc=Points to architecture-specific data, which is an array of IMAGE_ARCHITECTURE_HEADER structures. Not used for x86 or IA-64, but appears to have been used for DEC/Compaq Alpha.
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_GLOBALPTR=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_GLOBALPTR
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_GLOBALPTR_Idc=The VirtualAddress field is the RVA to be used as the global pointer (gp) on certain architectures. Not used on x86, but is used on IA-64. The Size field isn't used. See the November 2000 Under The Hood column for more information on the IA-64 gp.
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_TLS=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_TLS
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_TLS_Idc=Points to the Thread Local Storage initialization section.
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_LOAD_CONFIG=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_LOAD_CONFIG
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_LOAD_CONFIG_Idc=Points to an IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY structure. The information in an IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY is specific to Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP (for example, the GlobalFlag value). To put this structure in your executable, you need to define a global structure with the name __load_config_used, and of type IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY. For non-x86 architectures, the symbol name needs to be _load_config_used (with a single underscore). If you do try to include an IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY, it can be tricky to get the name right in your C++ code. The symbol name that the linker sees must be exactly: __load_config_used (with two underscores). The C++ compiler adds an underscore to global symbols. In addition, it decorates global symbols with type information. So, to get everything right, in your C++ code, you'd have something like this: extern "C" IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY _load_config_used = {...} 
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BOUND_IMPORT=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BOUND_IMPORT
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BOUND_IMPORT_Idc=Points to an array of IMAGE_BOUND_IMPORT_DESCRIPTORs, one for each DLL that this image has bound against. The timestamps in the array entries allow the loader to quickly determine whether the binding is fresh. If stale, the loader ignores the binding information and resolves the imported APIs normally.
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IAT=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IAT
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IAT_Idc=Points to the beginning of the first Import Address Table (IAT). The IATs for each imported DLL appear sequentially in memory. The Size field indicates the total size of all the IATs. The loader uses this address and size to temporarily mark the IATs as read-write during import resolution.
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DELAY_IMPORT=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DELAY_IMPORT
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DELAY_IMPORT_Idc=Points to the delayload information, which is an array of CImgDelayDescr structures, defined in DELAYIMP.H from Visual C++. Delayloaded DLLs aren't loaded until the first call to an API in them occurs. It's important to note that Windows has no implicit knowledge of delay loading DLLs. The delayload feature is completely implemented by the linker and runtime library.
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_COM_DESCRIPTOR=IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_COM_DESCRIPTOR
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_COM_DESCRIPTOR_Idc=This value has been renamed to IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_COMHEADER in more recent updates to the system header files. It points to the top-level information for .NET information in the executable, including metadata. This information is in the form of an IMAGE_COR20_HEADER structure.

SectionHeader=SectionHeader
Section=Section
SectionName=Name
SectionName_Idc=The ASCII name of the section. A section name is not guaranteed to be null-terminated. If you specify a section name longer than eight characters, the linker truncates it to eight characters in the executable. A mechanism exists for allowing longer section names in OBJ files. Section names often start with a period, but this is not a requirement. Section names with a $ in the name get special treatment from the linker. Sections with identical names prior to the $ character are merged. The characters following the $ provide an alphabetic ordering for how the merged sections appear in the final section. There's quite a bit more to the subject of sections with $ in the name and how they're combined, but the details are outside the scope of this article
Misc=PhysicalAddress
Misc_Idc=Indicates the actual, used size of the section. This field may be larger or smaller than the SizeOfRawData field. If the VirtualSize is larger, the SizeOfRawData field is the size of the initialized data from the executable, and the remaining bytes up to the VirtualSize should be zero-padded. This field is set to 0 in OBJ files.
SECTION_VirtualAddress=VirtualAddress
SECTION_VirtualAddress_Idc=In executables, indicates the RVA where the section begins in memory. Should be set to 0 in OBJs.
SizeOfRawData=SizeOfRawData
SizeOfRawData_Idc=The size (in bytes) of data stored for the section in the executable or OBJ. For executables, this must be a multiple of the file alignment given in the PE header. If set to 0, the section is uninitialized data.
PointerToRawData=PointerToRawData
PointerToRawData_Idc=The file offset where the data for the section begins. For executables, this value must be a multiple of the file alignment given in the PE header.
PointerToRelocations=PointerToRelocations
PointerToRelocations_Idc=The file offset of relocations for this section. This is only used in OBJs and set to zero for executables. In OBJs, it points to an array of IMAGE_RELOCATION structures if non-zero.
PointerToLinenumbers=PointerToLinenumbers
NumberOfRelocations=NumberOfRelocations
NumberOfRelocations_Idc=The number of relocations pointed to by the PointerToRelocations field. Should be 0 in executables.
NumberOfLinenumbers=NumberOfLinenumbers
NumberOfLinenumbers_Idc=The number of line numbers pointed to by the NumberOfRelocations field. Only used when COFF line numbers are emitted.
Characteristics=Characteristics
Characteristics_Idc=Flags OR'ed together, indicating the attributes of this section. Many of these flags can be set with the linker's /SECTION option. Common values include those listed in Figure 7.
