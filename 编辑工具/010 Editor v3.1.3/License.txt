TERM: If the Software was distributed to you as an EVALUATION VERSION, the license granted under this agreement commences upon the installation of the Software and is effective for 30 days following the date you install the Software. Evaluation Version Software may include program code to disable their functionality after the expiration of the evaluation term.

TERMINATION: Upon the expiration of the Evaluation Period (if any), your rights under this agreement will terminate automatically without notice from SweetScape Software. This agreement may also be terminated (a) by you, by returning the original Software and accompanying documentation, or (b) by SweetScape Software upon your breach of any of the provisions of this agreement. Upon termination of your rights under this agreement for any reason, you must destroy all copies of the Software and all components (including documentation) in your possession.

Upon the occurrence of such a transfer, your rights under this agreement terminate immediately. 

LIMITED WARRANTY:  SweetScape Software warrants to you (and only you) that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying documentation (if any) for a period of (90) days from the date of original purchase from an authorized retailer or directly from SweetScape Software (or the date you obtained authorization from SweetScape to convert an Evaluation version product to a Full-License product). Implied warranties on the Software, to the extent required by applicable law, are limited to ninety (90) days from the purchase date. The Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, use of the Software other than described in the documentation, use of the Software in combination with other products that are not described as compatible in the documentation, or your breach of the terms of this agreement. No individual and no reseller or retailer has any authority to amend or add to any of the above representations and disclaimers.

CUSTOMER REMEDY: Your exclusive remedy for any breach of the Limited Warranty is for you to send notice of the breach by returning to SweetScape Software a copy of your purchase receipt for your copy of the Software and a description of the alleged breach. Then, at SweetScape's option, SweetScape shall either: (a) terminate the license agreement and refund the license fee upon return of the Software and accompanying documentation or (b) repair or replacement of the Software that does not meet SweetScape's Limited warranty and which is returned. The Limited Warranty period for any replacement product will be extended for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days after the replacement is delivered to you, whichever is longer. If your license is for an Evaluation version, your exclusive remedy for any breach of this agreement, including a breach of the Limited Warranty, shall be to terminate your rights under this agreement.
