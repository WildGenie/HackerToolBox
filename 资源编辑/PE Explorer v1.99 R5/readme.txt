3 Program description
---------------------
 PE Explorer is a multi-purpose PE (portable executable) file editor and binary 
 header analysis tool for Windows developers. It tells you just about every little 
 detail you could possibly want to know about a PE file (exe, dll, ActiveX, and 
 several other executable formats). PE Explorer comes with a Visual Resource 
 Editor, PE Header Viewer, Exported/Imported API Function Viewer, API Function 
 Syntax Lookup, Dependency Scanner and Easy Disassembler. 

 XP Visual Style Manifest Wizard allows your application to take advantage 
 of the new common control styles and appearances featured in Windows XP.

 Sometimes you need to look inside of a program to figure out what's going on. 
 PE Explorer is a program for doing just such looking on Windows Portable Executable
 (PE) files. PE Explorer will let you open up any .exe or .dll file and plunge 
 right into the belly of the program. Once inside, file structure can be analyzed,
 problems diagnosed, changes made and resources repaired. You can check out 
 resources (bitmaps, icons, strings, etc) and make modifications without needing 
 to recompile. The product also allows you to edit the properties of controls on
 Delphi forms within the PE file (there's a very strong emphasis on peeking inside
 Delphi applications and packages).
