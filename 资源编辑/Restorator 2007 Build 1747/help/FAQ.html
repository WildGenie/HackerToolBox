<h1>Restorator<br>
FAQ</h1>
<h2 class=top>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<br>
<b>1. When will a new version of Restorator be available ?</b><br>
We usually do not disclose the release date of the next version. Check back often on <a href="http://www.bome.com/Restorator/help/../">
bome.com</a> [online] for latest news. There you can also subscribe to the
<a href="http://www.bome.com/Restorator/help/../list.php">announcement list</a> [online] to receive
an email when a new version is released.
<br>
<br>

<b>2. Restorator does not seem to open 16-bit files. Will there be support in the future ?</b><br>
No. Restorator is only for 32-bit files and 64-bit files.
<br>
<br>

<b>3. I have created a ResPatcher. Can I send it to friends ? Will there be copyright problems ? Can I sell it ?</b><br>
Yes, you can send it to anybody, and you will not infringe any copyrights, because ResPatchers only contain your work.
If you want to sell ResPatchers, please <a href="http://www.bome.com/Restorator/help/../contact.php?subject=Sell+ResPatchers">contact Bome Software</a> [online].
<br>
<br>

<b>4. Restorator displays "corrupt resource". What's wrong ?</b><br>
Most likely, this exe file is compressed and/or encrypted with an exe-packer (especially if all resources, except
sometimes icons and version, are marked corrupt). You need to look for an
unpacker on the Internet. Invoke the Properties on the exe file in Restorator to find out more about
the sections and to maybe get a clue which exe-packer has been used.<br>
<b>Notes:</b>
<ul class=nospace>
	<li>Since version 2005, Restorator comes with built-in support for the widely used UPX compressor.
	<li>By searching the Internet for &quot;unpacker download exe packer&quot; or so you'll most
		likely find programs to unpack your file so that it can be opened with Restorator.
</ul>
If you don't think that the corrupt resource is due to an encrypted and/or packed file,
please <a href="http://www.bome.com/Restorator/help/../contact.php?subject=Corrupt Resource">contact Bome Software</a> [online] with a detailed description how to reproduce this.
<br>
<br>

<b>5. I want to edit text XYZ, but Restorator cannot find the text</b><br>
Some programs may use or display texts that cannot be edited with Restorator. It modifies resources only,
so any text outside the resource section are out of scope for Restorator. You may have better
luck with a hex editor then.
<br>
<br>

<b>6. Can I have the source code of Restorator ?</b><br>
Please <a href="http://www.bome.com/Restorator/help/../contact.php?subject=License+Restorator+source+code">contact
Bome Software</a> [online] for
source code licensing.
<br>
<br>

<b>7. I found a problem with Restorator. Where can I report this bug ?</b><br>
Please report the bug in the bug report in the
<a href="http://www.bome.com/Restorator/help/../../forums/viewforum.php?f=2"><b>bug report discussion forum</b></a> [online].
<br>
<br>

<b>8. What types of files can I modify?</b><br>
Genererally, you can view and modify files with windows resources.
These are either executable files (<i>PE files</i> for Portable Executable), RES Files, or RC Files.<br>
The most common PE files are: .exe, .dll, .scr and .ocx files.<br>
RES files have the extension .res, and RC files end with .rc.<br>
For details, <a href="help.html#_Resource_Files_1">see the help file</a>.<br>
<br>

<b>9. Is Restorator a tool for experts only or can I use it as a
non-programmer?</b><br>
Restorator is helpful either way. Programmers will appreciate it for
post-compilation tweaking and to understand their applications better.
Designers will use it to modify the look and feel with Restorator's easy user
interface without touching any code at all. Last but not least, it can be
used to translate an application by anyone. The
<a href="tutorials.html">tutorials</a> provide easy
step-by-step instructions on how to go about it.
<br>
<br>

<b>10. Does Restorator supply a command line version?</b><br>
Yes, you can execute
Restorator directly from the command line. E.g. conveniently from a batch
program, for automated execution. You can extract resources and assemble
applications again. It is also possible to incorporate Restorator or a
ResPatch into installation programs (like InstallShield) to automate
resource patching during installation (note that you can only distribute
ResPatchers for free, you cannot distribute Restorator!).<br>

<br>
<br>

<b>11. I would like to show or distribute a modified 3rd party
application.</b><br>
You can create a ResPatcher that allows to create a small executable
that automatically modifies another application.<br>
See also <a href="help.html">Help</a> and <a href="tutorials.html">Tutorials</a>.
<br>
<br>

<b>12. I like the application, but a specific feature is missing - what can I do?</b><br>
Please post your feature requests in the
<a href="http://www.bome.com/Restorator/help/../../forums/viewforum.php?f=6"><b>feature request discussion forum</b></a> [online].<br>
We will try to
accommodate the request in a future version, but
the list of requests is long. If it is an option for you, you can pay for the
development: we will create a customized version or prioritize your
request for the next release.
<br>
<br>
